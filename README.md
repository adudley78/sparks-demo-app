Sparks is an application for sharing and discussing articles, questions, and points about philosophy. Each share is intended to "spark" a conversation, hence the name. I'm building this application because I founded and run a philosophy discussion club that meets in-person every couple of weeks in Central Florida near where I live.

The back-end is Ruby on Rails serving as the API for the React front-end.
