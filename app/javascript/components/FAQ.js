                Use the submit link in the top bar, and leave the url field blank.

            </p><p>
                No. Users should vote for a story because they personally find it
                intellectually interesting, not because someone has content to
                promote.
            </p><p>
                Sparks's software penalizes submissions, accounts, and sites that
                break this rule, so please don't.

            </p><p>
                No, for the same reason. It's also not in your interest, because HN
                readers will figure it out, flag the thread, and use unkind words like
                'spam'.
